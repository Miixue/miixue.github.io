<h2>some things to know</h2>

<p>
My name is Michelle Tan. I am currently a second-semester high school senior at Los Gatos High School, soon to be freshman at the University of California, Los Angeles. My prospective major is biology, though I am considering a shift into biomedical engineering. Only time and interest in my courses will tell.  </p>
<p>
In my free time, you can catch me doing digital art, reading, or playing badminton with friends. I enjoy marathoning Disney movies like <i>Big Hero 6</i> or <i>Tangled</i>, and I especially love the Captain America movies. I'll also work on side projects like my writings for Fiction for Kids and community service projects with Interact. </p>

<h2>technical skills</h2>

<p>

I am moderately proficient in the elementals of CSS and HTML and know the basics of Java. I am a demon with Clip Studio Paint (a digital art program) and an amateur demon with Photoshop CS5. Some of my storied talents include improvising a tape measure from a straight ruler and chunk of string, ice-skating circles around my friends, and breaking into my own house.
